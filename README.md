# To-Do-List-App

 Simple MVC App built from scratch with JavaScript


Based on a tutorial by Tania Rascia, which explains the different components of an MVC app. 

The three major components being the three listed below:

The Model
The View
The Controller

Where the Model and the View never touch, instead the Controller connects them, or "controls their actions".
The layout and actions are built in the model and view, but the controller decides how to use them.
